## Client-Side Rendering {#client-side-rendering}

![Client Side Rendering](/BL-1002/csr.png)

**Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** refers to the process where the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and uses JavaScript to render the content dynamically. Here's how it works:

- **Initial Load:** The server sends a basic HTML structure along with JavaScript files.
- **Rendering:** The JavaScript executes in the browser, fetching data and rendering the UI components.
- **Subsequent Navigations:** Navigations between pages are handled on the client side, leading to faster transitions without full page reloads.

### Advantages of CSR

- **Interactive UIs:** Enables highly interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Reduced Server Load:** Since rendering occurs on the client, the server can handle more requests with less computational overhead.
- **Rich User Experience:** Smooth transitions and real-time updates enhance the user experience.

### Disadvantages of CSR

- **Initial Load Time:** The first load can be slower as the browser needs to download and execute JavaScript before rendering content.
- **SEO Challenges:** Search engine crawlers may struggle to index content generated by JavaScript, potentially impacting SEO.
- **Accessibility Issues:** Users with JavaScript disabled or with older browsers may face accessibility issues.

## Server-Side Rendering {#server-side-rendering}

![Server Side Rendering](/BL-1002/ssr.png)

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** involves generating the full HTML for a page on the server in response to each client request. Here's the process:

- **Request Handling:** When a user requests a page, the server fetches necessary data.
- **HTML Generation:** The server renders the complete HTML page with the fetched data.
- **Response:** The fully formed HTML is sent to the client's browser for display.

### Advantages of SSR

- **Faster Initial Load:** Users see content faster since the HTML is pre-rendered.
- **Improved SEO:** Search engines can easily crawl and index the fully rendered HTML content.
- **Better Performance on Low-Powered Devices:** Rendering on the server reduces the computational burden on client devices.

### Disadvantages of SSR

- **Increased Server Load:** Each request requires the server to render the page, which can be resource-intensive.
- **Slower Subsequent Navigations:** Navigations may involve full page reloads, leading to slower transitions compared to CSR.
- **Complexity:** Implementing SSR can introduce additional complexity to the application architecture.

## Static Site Generation {#static-site-generation}

**Static Site Generation (SSG)** is a technique where HTML pages are generated at build time, using predetermined data. These static pages are then served to users upon request.

### How SSG Works

- **Build Time:** During the build process, the application fetches all necessary data and generates static HTML files.
- **Deployment:** The generated static files are deployed to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for rapid distribution.
- **Runtime:** When a user requests a page, the CDN serves the pre-generated static HTML, ensuring swift delivery.

### Advantages of SSG

- **Optimal Performance:** Static files are served quickly from CDNs, providing excellent load times.
- **Scalability:** Serving static files reduces server strain, allowing the application to handle high traffic effortlessly.
- **Security:** Fewer server-side operations mean a reduced attack surface.

### Disadvantages of SSG

- **Build Time Constraints:** Large sites with numerous pages may experience lengthy build times.
- **Limited Dynamism:** Content that changes frequently may not be ideal for static generation unless combined with revalidation strategies.

## Challenges with React.js {#challenges-with-reactjs}

While **React.js** revolutionized frontend development with its component-based architecture and client-side rendering, it introduces several challenges:

1. **Blank Initial Page:** React applications initially load an almost empty HTML structure (`<div id="root"></div>`), leading to a white screen until JavaScript loads and renders the content.
2. **SEO Limitations:** Since content is rendered on the client side, search engine crawlers that do not execute JavaScript may fail to index the site's content effectively.
3. **Performance Concerns:** Large JavaScript bundles can slow down the initial load time, especially on slower networks or devices.

### Impact on User Experience and SEO

- **User Experience:** Delays in rendering content can frustrate users, especially those on limited bandwidth or using older devices.
- **SEO Performance:** Poor SEO can result in lower search engine rankings, reducing the site's visibility and organic traffic.

## Prerendering with Next.js {#prerendering-with-nextjs}

**Next.js** addresses the challenges of React's client-side rendering by offering powerful prerendering techniques: **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. These methods enhance performance, SEO, and overall user experience.

### getStaticProps {#getstaticprops}

`getStaticProps` is a Next.js function that allows you to fetch data at build time. This data is then used to generate static HTML pages during the build process.

#### How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** `getStaticProps` runs at build time, fetching necessary data from APIs or databases.
- **Static Generation:** The fetched data is used to generate static HTML files for each page.
- **Revalidation:** By setting the `revalidate` property, you can specify intervals at which Next.js will regenerate the page if the data has changed.

#### Example Use

```
// This function gets called at build time on server-side.
export async function getStaticProps() {
const res = await fetch('https://.../data');
const data = await res.json();

// By returning { props: data }, the Dashboard component
// will receive `data` as a prop at build time
return {
props: {
data
},
// Check if data changes every 60 seconds.
// Rebuild page if different
revalidate: 60
};
}

// data will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()
export default function Dashboard({ data }) {
return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

### getServerSideProps {#getserversideprops}

`getServerSideProps` is a Next.js function that fetches data on each request, ensuring that the content is always up-to-date.

#### How It Works

- **Request Handling:** Every time a user requests a page, `getServerSideProps` runs on the server.
- **Data Fetching:** It fetches the latest data required for the page.
- **HTML Generation:** Generates HTML with the fetched data and sends it to the client's browser.

#### Example Use

```
// This function gets called on every request on the server-side.
export async function getServerSideProps() {
const res = await fetch('https://.../data');
const data = await res.json();

// By returning { props: data }, the Dashboard component
// will receive `data` as a prop on each request
return {
props: {
data
}
};
}

// The Dashboard component receives `data` as a prop
export default function Dashboard({ data }) {
return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

### Benefits of getStaticProps

- **Performance:** Static pages load quickly from the CDN.
- **SEO-Friendly:** Pre-rendered HTML improves SEO.
- **Scalability:** Serving static files reduces server strain.

### Benefits of getServerSideProps

- **Dynamic Content:** Ensures that users always receive the most recent data.
- **SEO-Friendly:** Pre-rendered HTML enhances SEO performance.
- **Personalization:** Ability to tailor content based on user-specific data or requests.

### Trade-offs Between getStaticProps and getServerSideProps

| Feature               | getStaticProps                              | getServerSideProps                        |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Time**    | Build time                                   | Every request                             |
| **Performance**       | Faster, served from CDN                      | Slower, server-dependent                  |
| **Use Case**          | Static content that doesn't change often     | Dynamic content that needs to be up-to-date |
| **Caching**           | Easy to cache with revalidation              | Requires server resources for each request |

## Benefits of Using Next.js {#benefits-of-using-nextjs}
